### **Project Title: Super Store Sales Dashboard Using Power BI**

The **Super Store Dashboard project** is a comprehensive data analysis and business intelligence solution developed using **Microsoft Power BI**. The goal of this project is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights through dynamic dashboards that highlight sales performance, regional trends, product profitability, and customer behavior. Designed for decision-makers, this interactive dashboard empowers users to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and make data-driven strategic decisions to improve business operations, optimize inventory, and enhance profitability.

- `Profit Margin = DIVIDE(SUM(Profit), SUM(Sales))`  
- `Avg Order Value = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales), COUNTROWS(Orders))`  
- `YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], Date[Order Date])`  
- `Sales Growth % = DIVIDE([This Year Sales] - [Last Year Sales], [Last Year Sales])`
